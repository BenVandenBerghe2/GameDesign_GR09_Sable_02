Mission Design

The player start in a plane and has to move towards an NPC that is visible at first sight in an upper plataform. So the player will need to jump and climb to reach it.
Once reached a pop up will show "Press X"
Pressing the key will trigger the dialog and dialog system:
      NPC: Oh player, my cat Fabricio has snucked into the old temple, would you be so kind to bring it to me?
      Player: Yes
          NPC: Excelent! I will wait for your here. You can use my old bike to get there is behind me.
Pop up appear: "Rescue the cat"
      Player: No
          NPC: Me cago en tus muertos pisoteados.
The Compass start showing a new icon with a cat shape.

The old temple is at first sight from the NPC plataform, separated from the it trough a plain and a few mounds/slopes (desert like). 
The plataform is in a small cliff so the player will have to jump from it, so they can use the gliding.
When in the air a pop up will appear: "Press Y to glide"
The bike will just behind the cliff, a little further to be on the gliding distance.

After reaching the temple the player will have to climb to the base of it, where the door is. 
Also jump into different plataforms precisely and glide.
A few plataforms will be optional to reach (at least 1 or 2) with a collectible on it.

Once infront of the temple the player will have to press a button to open the door.
In the actual room the player will have to pick up 3 different objects placed in paltaforms that they will have to reach and place them in the correct place.
Inside the temple the player will see the car behind a door.
After that the door will be openned. The cat will make a really uncanny sound or say something stupid and will be pickable.

Once picked up the compass will change direction to the NPC.
Once the NPC is reached same pop up to intercat will appear. Once pressed the dialog will appear:
  NPC: Te como la cara, thank you very much!
